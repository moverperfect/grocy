Please describe the bug as detailed as possible, provide the steps how to reproduce it and maybe attach screenshots where useful.

Please also check if your bug was maybe already fixed by searching closed issues here or by trying to reproduce your problem on the [pre-release demo](https://demo-prerelease.grocy.info/) (use a *private demo instance* if you want to make your example persistent).
